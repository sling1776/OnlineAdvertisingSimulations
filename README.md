# Exploring Uncertainty Algorithms in the Context of Internet Advertisement

Our project will focus on three areas of internet advertisement: User response, advertisement space, and advertisement competition.

In our project we intend to use three algorithms: Explore and Exploit, Monte Carlo algorithms with advertising strategies similar to options, and Game Theory. 


## User Response

```UserResponse.py```

Description of why.

For this side of internet advertising, we plan on using an explore and exploit algorithm.

To run ```UserResponse.py``` you will need the following:

* Insert required libraries here


## Advertising Space

```AdvertisingSpace.py```

Description of why.

We believe that a monte carlo algorithm similar to stock options can be utilized to solve the problem of advertising space pricing.

To run ```AdvertisingSpace.py``` you will need the following:

* Insert required libraries here


## Advertisement Competition

```AdvertisementCompetitors.py```

Description of why.

Game theory algorithms will be implemented for simulation of this side of iternet advertisement.

To run ```AdvertisementCompetitors.py``` you will need the following:

* Insert required libraries here
